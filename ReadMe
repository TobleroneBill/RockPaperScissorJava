This is something I made in like mid Feburary 2022, when I first started learning programming in Java.
I'm sure there are tonnes of issues to be pointed out, but I just want some concrete proof that I have actually made something to be on the WEB

Also the actual Jar file doesnt play sound if you get confused. Audio is something that I hate working with in java because it needs some wierd ass code to 
function properly



Go to SRC in the folder to see the Java code (only 2 files)
